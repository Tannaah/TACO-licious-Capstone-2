# 🌮 Let's Taco 'Bout It! 🌮
### (Taco Restaurant Management System Application)
----
This is a object-oriented console-based restaurant management system built in Java! This program allows users to build taco orders, add sides and drinks, and receive receipt files.

This system demonstrates strong Object-Oriented Programing design using:
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Abstraction

Every part of the order process — tacos, drinks, toppings, sides, and signature items. All are represented in its own class, making the system easy to read and maintain.

-------------------------
## Design and Thought Process

Before writing code, I identified the main components based on the Capstone Project Description. Such as the Classes, Packages and the organization. I also noted that the system needed a way to interact with users, manage pricing, and generate receipts.

Pre-code Ideas:

An order contains multiple tacos or other menu items.

Separate classes manage the Menu(s), provide order, and console interaction.

File I/O is used to generate receipt files for each completed order.

-------------------------
## Features (to implement)

Create and customize tacos (shell, meat, cheese, toppings, sauces, extras).

Add drinks or chips & salsa to orders.

Display full order summary and total cost.

Save receipt file with unique date-time filename.

Handle input validation and cancel/exit options gracefully.

## How to Run

Clone the repository from GitHub.

Open the project in IntelliJ.

Run Main.java to start the application.
